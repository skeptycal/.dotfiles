# Shorthand for text files.
# - Treat them as text.
# - Ensure no CRLF line-endings, neither on checkout nor on checkin.
# - Detect whitespace errors.
#   - Exposed by default in `git diff --color` on the CLI.
#   - Validate with `git diff --check`.
#   - Deny applying with `git apply --whitespace=error-all`.
#   - Fix automatically with `git apply --whitespace=fix`.

# Shorthand for binary files.
# - Do not treat them as text.
# - Include binary diff in patches instead of "binary files differ."

# Auto-detect text files, ensure they use LF.
* text=auto eol=lf
# (When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line conversion. If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are converted to LF on checkin.)
# **When the file has been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.**

# Shell scripts, autoconf, etc. must have LF endings, even on Windows
